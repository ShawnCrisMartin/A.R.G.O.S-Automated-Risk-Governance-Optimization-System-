# A.R.G.O.S-Automated-Risk-Governance-Optimization-System-
I developed ARGOS (Automated Risk &amp; Governance Optimization System), which automates the detection of risky transactions in financial data. It uses rule-based checks, like flagging large transactions, and machine learning (Isolation Forest) to identify unusual activity. ARGOS also visualizes the data to help manage and mitigate risks.
